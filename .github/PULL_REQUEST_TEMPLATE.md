**JIRA Ticket URL:** https://jira.devfactory.com/browse/JIRA-?????

**Changes proposed in the pull request:**
- It does ....
-
-

**Checklist**
- [ ] I checked I'm only including the changes I intend to make and nothing else
- [ ] The PR summary starts with the ticket number, e.g.: 'JIRA-?????: ....'
- [ ] The latest changes from develop branch are merged
- [ ] The build/checks has been verified to succeed
- [ ] All the reviewers are assigned (PCA & Easier CA at least)
- [ ] The required unit tests are added
- [ ] The change was tested on local and the demo/evidence attached
- [ ] If this PR is chained to another, have you added a note like: 'IMPORTANT: This PR is chained with #...'

To fail the previous checklist will just delay the approval of your PR.

Notes:
- You should not send changes on files beacuse of spacing or formatting if not intended (avoid unnecessary conflicts).
- The chained PR indication allows the reviewer to know if some PR has to be validated/merged before this one.
- You can help your PR to pass using the right labels (e.g. Easier, Ready for Review, etc.)
